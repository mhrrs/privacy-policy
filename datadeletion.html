  <h1>Data Deletion Policies</h1>
  <p>You will be pleased to know that we don't store long-term personal data if you only mentioned our account. Your data was deleted from our servers as soon as you sent it to us.</p>
  <p>We do this because we cannot afford to keep it and don't really care to do so anyways.</p>
  <p>If you are an account who has found that your post has been receiving mentions to my account and you do not want your post to be a part of my account, simply add: #notyourtoptenmeme to your post before posting and my system will flag and remove your post from ever being posted by my account.</p>
  <br>
  <p>HOWEVER... If you have found that your post has already been my mentioned by my account (my posts always will tag your account as the provider of the top ten meme), then simply DM me saying "STOPTOPTEN123" without the quotes and I will remove your post(s) from my server and my account.</p>
